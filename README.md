# Object-Detection-model
This is a simple object deetection program written in python which detect common objects in an image.

Libraries used : `cv2` `numpy` `cvlib` `PIL` `matplotlib`<br><br>
`YOLOv3` model is used for this program to detect objects.<br><br>
`YOLO` is a Real-time object detection model which is extremely fast and accurate<br><br>
Documentation of YOLO: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

## How to run this project locally ?

Install required libraries

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run using jupytor notebook
Run the cells respectively one after another

### How to run in the terminal
```
python objectdetection.py
```

This program is written to read a one image at a time, if you need to play with different images, you are required to pass it to the program.
